# ⚽ 5v5 Robot Soccer System

A complete **5v5 robot soccer software stack** integrating perception, strategy, communication, GUI, and simulation.

This project uses:

* **ROS 2** for distributed robotics middleware
* **Qt** for the operator GUI
* **Isaac Sim** for high-fidelity simulation and testing

The system is designed for real-time multi-robot coordination and can run in both **simulation** and **real robot** modes.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Multi-robot (5v5) architecture
* ✅ Vision processing pipeline
* ✅ Strategy & decision making
* ✅ Real-time robot communication
* ✅ Qt-based control GUI
* ✅ Isaac Sim integration
* ✅ ROS 2 modular design
* ✅ Simulation ↔ real robot consistency

## 🧠 System Architecture

```
Isaac Sim
   │  (ROS 2 Bridge: camera / ground truth / physics)
   ▼
Vision → Vision processed results → Strategy → Communication → Robots
                                   ▲
                                   │
                                  GUI

```
### 🔄 Data Flow

* **Isaac Sim**

  * publishes simulated camera images via ROS 2 bridge
  * publishes robot & ball ground truth (optional)
  * receives robot command topics
* **Vision**

  * consumes real-time images from Isaac Sim or real cameras
* **Strategy**

  * computes team behaviors
* **Communication**

  * sends commands to robots **or back to Isaac Sim robots**
* **GUI**

  * monitors and controls the full pipeline

### Modules

| Module        | Description                         |

## 🔧 Requirements

### System

* Ubuntu 22.04 (recommended)
* ROS 2 Humble 
* Qt 5 >= 14.0
* NVIDIA GPU (for Isaac Sim) 

### ROS 2 Dependencies

Install ROS 2 first:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
```

Install additional packages as needed:

```bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

---

## ⚙️ Build

```bash
mkdir -p ~/robosoccer_ws
cd ~/robosoccer_ws

# clone repo
git clone <your-repo-url> src

# install deps
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

# build
colcon build --symlink-install

# source
source install/setup.bash
```

---

## 🖥️ Run the System

### 1️⃣ Launch Core System

```bash
ros2 launch gui_robosoccer launch.py
```


### 2️⃣ Run Isaac Sim

Start Isaac Sim and load the provided scene:

```
isaac_sim/scenes/robosoccer_5v5.usd
```
